This repository contains the website **[wurstmineberg.de](http://wurstmineberg.de/)**.

wurstmineberg.de is meant to be updated via pulls from here, with as little changes to the deployed website directly as possible.

# General management

Like most of our repositories, this is also connected to [our autodeploy setup](https://github.com/fenhl/gitdir-autodeploy), so pushed commits should go live on the website very soon.

Please commit all changes to the dev branch of this repository first, which is set up to be displayed on [dev.wurstmineberg.de](http://dev.wurstmineberg.de/). The dev branch may then be merged into master after making sure that things look right.
