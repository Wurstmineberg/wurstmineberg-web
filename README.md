wurstmineberg.de
=================

Trying to make collaborative website updates a little less funky.
wurstmineberg.de is meant to be updated via pulls from here, with as little changes to the deployed website directly as possible.  

General management
------------------  
Like most of our repositories, this is also connected to our autodeploy setup, so pushed commits should go live on the website very soon.  

For bigger changes, see the dev branch of this repository, which is set up to be displayed on the [dev version of our site](http://dev.wurstmineberg.de/), which is handy for testing out experimental features.
