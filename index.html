                <p class="lead">Wurstmineberg is a whitelisted vanilla <a href="http://www.minecraft.net">Minecraft</a> server, and a subproject of the Wurstmannberg meta label, which doesn't really mean anything anymore. Come to think of it, it never really did. Oh well, now it does.</p>
                <p>The server usually runs the latest version of Minecraft, which means we also try to run the latest <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Version_history/Development_versions">stable snapshots</a>. Therefore we can't really use awesome things like <a href="http://bukkit.org/">bukkit</a>. We also don't run any serverside mods for that reason …Sorry.</p>
                <p>If you're interested in playing with us, we're currently working on some guidelines. In the meantime you can check out the IRC and Twitter section below.</p>

                <p>We set up the <a href="http://overviewer.org/">Minecraft Overviewer</a> to generate a daily overview map of our world. It tends to drain a lot of resources, so we apologize for not running it every 10 minutes or so, and to ensure it contains the least amount of suck, make sure to tell us <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/wurstmineberg/comments/1kgem1/psa_the_great_where_you_atsurvey_of_wurstmineberg/">where you are</a> or make the <a href="https://github.com/wurstmineberg/wurstmineberg-web/blob/master/overviewer.conf">pull request</a> yourself.</p>

                <h2 id="irc"><img src="assets/img/irc.png" alt="" /> IRC</h2>
                <p>We use the bleeding edge of Internet technology. That's why our primary means of communication is an <abbr title=">20yr old technology">IRC</abbr> channel on <a href="http://freenode.net/">Freenode</a>. Feel free to join us there if you're interested in playing on the server or just generally want to say hi and / or talk about… Stuff?</p>

                <p>Organizing events and announcing changes to our server is easier in a spot like our restricted subreddit (meaning: "read only" for strangers). You'll find attempts to organize events, announcements and probably some other stuff on the long run. We thought it would be a good place to update everyone on, well, everything.</p>

                <p>We integrated Twitter in our server/IRC bot and now we have automated tweets. Sometimes it's a death message, sometimes it's the server telling us that he's lonely, sometimes it's a list of currently online players, sometimes a snippet from IRC shenanigans. It's emotional.</p>
                <p>It's also the easiest way to get in touch with us.</p>

                <p>Things are changing right now. We just rented a full blown rootserver to handle our minecrafty goodness (and the overviewer), and that thing costs a lot more than our previous vServer. See our <a href="http://wurstmineberg.de/about#finance">finance section</a> for more info. Otherwise you can still chip in via flattr.</p>

                <p>We have a GitHub organization where we keep most of our stuff. <a href="/people#fenhl">Fenhl</a>'s IRC Bot is already up, and the reworked init.d script for easy management is coming up soon, too. Feautures include Minecraft and IRC chatsyncing, Twitter integration and the countless tools you see on this page. (Javascript required) We also have two single-serving sites for the current <a href="//time.wurstmineberg.de">server time</a> and <a href="//isitraining.wurstmineberg.de"> weather conditions</a> (forecast coming soon!)</p>

                <p>How cliché, right? Yes, kind of. But everything's better than group Skype call bulshittery and the likes. Because sometimes it's just nice to talk to people. It's experimental right now, but someone has to test it.</p>
                <p>You can get the password on the IRC and the client, if necessary, over <a href="http://www.teamspeak.com/?page=downloads">there</a>.</p>
                <p><small>And if you ask why we didn't setup a mumble server, you may or may not be punched in the mood</small></p>

                <p>We set up a <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/">MediaWiki</a> to harvest the glorious benefits of wiki-technology for our purposes. While the subreddit is an okay place to discuss things, some things just need a broader and more collaborative space to be planned, documented or collected. We can't put <em>everything</em> into Google Docs which get abandoned/forgotten/ignored over time. The Wiki might not seem like a big deal as of now, but as time passes and we expand, it can only be helpful.</p>
