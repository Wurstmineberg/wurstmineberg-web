                <p class="lead">Wurstmineberg is a whitelisted vanilla <a href="http://www.minecraft.net">Minecraft</a> server, and a subproject of the Wurstmannberg meta label, which doesn't really mean anything anymore. Come to think of it, it never really did. Oh well, now it does.</p>
                <p>The server usually runs the latest version of Minecraft, which means we also try to run the latest <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Version_history/Development_versions">stable snapshots</a>. Therefore we can't really use awesome things like <a href="http://bukkit.org/">bukkit</a>. We also don't run any serverside mods for that reason …Sorry. But we do have some awesome selfmade tools that really replace lots of that functionality.</p>
                <p>If you're interested in playing with us, we have some <a href="http://wiki.wurstmineberg.de/Server_invitations">requirements</a>. In the meantime, you can check out the IRC and Twitter section below.</p>

                <p>We set up <a href="http://overviewer.org/">Minecraft Overviewer</a> to generate a daily overview map of our world. It tends to drain <abbr title="Seriously. What are they even *doing*?">a lot</abbr> of resources, and has some weird bugs like player base markers not showing up, so <a href="/people/farthen">Farthen</a> and <a href="/people/efrane">eFrane</a> are currently writing <a href="https://github.com/wurstmineberg/mcmap/tree/rewrite">something better</a>.</p>

                <p>We use the bleeding edge of internet technology. That's why our primary means of communication is an <abbr title="> 20yr old technology">IRC</abbr> channel on <a href="http://freenode.net/">Freenode</a>. Feel free to join us there if you're interested in playing on the server or just generally want to say hi and / or talk about… Stuff?</p>

                <p>We integrated Twitter in our server/IRC bot and now we have <abbr title="It tends to get kinda spammy when new users arrive but you will get used to it">automated tweets</abbr>. Sometimes it's a death message, sometimes it's the server telling us that he's lonely, sometimes it's a list of currently online players, sometimes a snippet from IRC shenanigans. <abbr title="At least we tried!">It's emotional</abbr>.</p>
                <p>It's also the <abbr title="For certain values of easy, at least">easiest</abbr> way to get in touch with us.</p>

                <p>Since we're running on an actual server that requires actual monies to run, we decided to try a "Donate if you will, or don't But it woud be pretty dandy if you would"-model. See our <a href="http://wurstmineberg.de/about#finance">finance section</a> for more info. Otherwise you can still chip in via flattr, even though it doesn't really do much except show appreciation, which is also cool.</p>

                <p>We have a github organization where we keep most of our stuff, like <a href="https://github.com/wurstmineberg/wurstminebot">the IRC Bot</a>, <a href="https://github.com/wurstmineberg/init-minecraft">the reworked init.d script for easy management</a>, and even <a href="https://github.com/wurstmineberg/wurstmineberg-web">this website</a>. We also have two single-serving sites for the current <a href="//time.wurstmineberg.de">server time</a> and <a href="//isitraining.wurstmineberg.de"> weather conditions</a> (<abbr title="Seriously. We need Javascript for nearly everything">Javascript required</abbr>). There's also the <a href="http://api.wurstmineberg.de">wurstmineberg APU</a>, which makes a lot of cool stuff possible, like our statistics page.</p>

                <p>How cliché, right? Yes, kind of. But everything's better than group Skype call bulshittery and the likes. Because sometimes it's just nice to talk to people. It's experimental right now, but someone has to test it.</p>
                <p>You can get the password on the IRC and the client, if necessary, over <a href="http://www.teamspeak.com/?page=downloads">there</a>.</p>

                <p>We set up a <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/">MediaWiki</a> to harvest the glorious benefits of wiki-technology for our purposes. While the subreddit is an okay place to discuss things, we can't put <em>everything</em> into Google Docs which get abandoned/forgotten/ignored over time.</p>
                <p>Besides meta stuff, we're also writing articles about <a href="http://wiki.wurstmineberg.de/Category:Projects">projects</a> on the server itself. This might not seem like a big deal as of now, but things are slowly coming together, and eventually we'll have documented <em>all</em> the things.</p>

                <h2 id="subreddit"><img src="assets/img/subreddit.png" alt="" /> Subreddit</h2>
                <p>We have a restricted subreddit (meaning: "read only" for strangers). We created it because we thought it would be a good place to update everyone on, well, everything. It's not used anymore because most of its functionality has been replaced by the wiki, but it still serves as a record of server history. You'll find attempts to organize events, announcements, and lots of Google docs.</p>
