        <p class="lead">Wurstmineberg is a whitelisted Minecraft server with a small number of active people. Our main world is a vanilla world running on the latest release. We sometimes also have a second modded world that is reset regularly. We do a lot of background and infrastructure work to make the most out of the vanilla Minecraft experience.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="panel-footer">
        <p>Due to some major infrastructure changes, none of our worlds are currently running. We will start <a href="#finance">raising the money</a> to get the main world back online soon™.</p>

<h2 id="hosting">Hosting <small>Because Minecraft doesn't run on potatoes</small></h2>
<p>Our hosting situation has changed many times now. We started out on a spare MacBook in a living room, tried commercial Minecraft server hosters, set everything up ourselves on a VPS, then a physical server, and are back to a VPS now.</p>
<p>For more details and a brief history of the server, read {{ wiki('Hosting', 'the Hosting article on our wiki') }}.</p>
<h2 id="joining">Joining <small>Want to play with us?</small></h2>
<p>If you're thinking about joining the server or wondering how you can, read on. First, though, there are a few things we would like to let you know about what playing on the server is like.</p>
<ul>
    <li>While we'll be starting out basically from scratch at {{ wiki('Renascence#Zucchini', 'Zucchini') }}, the area where we played previously is located some number of kilometers away from spawn on the same world, and it was pretty much end-game, as far as <a href="/stats#achievements">the achievement progress</a> is concerned. The original dragon has been dead for ages and the {{ wiki('Category:End', 'End' ) }} has been turned into {{ wiki('Ender_ender_2.0', 'an XP farm') }}. If you want to start from scratch, we recommend staying away from that area for a while.</li>
    <li>We think of a lot of stuff as public which you might expect to be treated differently. {#For example, the <code>!{{ wiki('Commands#Leak', 'Leak') }}</code> command allows people to publish parts of the chatlog to Twitter, and all sorts of in-game data like your inventory and statistics are publicly available through <a href="//api.{{g.host}}/v2/">our API</a>.#}</li> {#TODO new examples #}
    <li>We have a {{ wiki('Code_of_Conduct', 'code of conduct') }}.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now for the actual invitation process, just ask one of our members to invite you. See <a href="/">the main page</a> for ways to contact us.</p>
<h2 id="starter">Getting started</h2>
<p>We'll be starting from scratch together in our Renascence project, Zucchini. A date poll will be held once this whole finance thing has been sorted to reasonable extent.</p>
{#
<p>If you're new and don't know where to go and what to do, chances are you didn't get a {{ wiki('Tour', 'server tour') }} by one of our more senior members. Sorry about that. The first thing you'll see is our {{ wiki('Category:Spawn', 'spawn area') }}, which is rather obviously still being built, like so many things on the server. “Beneath” the spawn area is our {{ wiki('Newther_Hub', 'Nether hub' ) }}, which serves as a central community trafficking area and connects various tunnels to other peoples's Nether portals. Both the Nether hub and spawn area are community oriented builds. All the supplies there are either donated or specifically collected for specific builds or purposes, so… well, the general rule is “Don't be a dick”. If something has a sign with “free to take” on it, you can probably take it. Taking <em>everything</em> is generally frowned upon for reasons of obviousness. Also, even if there are usually some community supplies floating around (like steak), please don't rely on them as your only means of, you know, not starving to death.</p>
<p>If you'd like to work on community builds like spawners, {{ wiki('Category:Farms', 'farms' ) }} or whatever, please try to ask around some of the other people who may or may not have already started preparations for such builds. It's not about <em>owning</em> a community project, it's just about coordination and not stepping on people's toes. However, experience shows that you probably won't be murdered in your sleep if you build at spawn without discussing every minor detail with everyone. Hanging around on {{ wiki('Slack', 'Slack') }} and/or checking out the <a href="https://twitter.com/wurstmineberg">Twitter account</a> and/or checking out the {{ wiki('/', 'wiki') }} should give a start as to what's currently going on. And sometimes it doesn't.</p>
<p>As I was saying, it's about community. As long as you're being reasonable and remember you're not alone on this server (both for your and everybody else's benefit), everything's fine.</p>

<h2 id="finance">Financial stuff</h2>
<p>The Wurstmineberg infrastructure runs on a VPS with monthly costs. Members may contribute to paying for these expenses on a voluntary basis. Depending on how much money is available, we will upgrade or downgrade the hardware on which the server runs.</p>
