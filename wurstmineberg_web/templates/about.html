        <p class="lead">Wurstmineberg is a whitelisted Minecraft server with a small number of active people. Our main world is a vanilla snapshot world where we try to run the latest and greatest stuff, at least if it is not too broken. We also have a second modded world that is reset regularly. We do a lot of background and infrastructure work to make the most out of the vanilla Minecraft experience.</p>

<h2 id="hosting">Hosting <small>Because Minecraft doesn't run on potatoes</small></h2>
<p>Our hosting situation has changed many times now. We started out on a spare MacBook in a living room, tried commercial Minecraft server hosters, set everything up ourselves on a VPS and then moved on to hosting on a physical server. Our server is quite powerful right now and is able to run multiple worlds simultaneously without any major issues.</p>
<p>For more details and a brief history of the server, read {{ wiki('Hosting', 'the Hosting article on our wiki') }}.</p>
<h2 id="joining">Joining <small>Want to play with us?</small></h2>
<p>If you're thinking about joining the server or wondering how you can, read on. First, though, there are a few things we would like to let you know about what playing on the server is like.</p>
<ul>
    <li>We're a {{ mcwiki('Version_history/Development_versions', 'snapshot') }} server, which means that we're helping Mojang improve their game. Expect weirdness and make yourself familiar with <a href="https://bugs.mojang.com/">the bug tracker</a>.</li>
    <li>We're pretty much end-game on the main world, as far as <a href="/stats#achievements">the achievement progress</a> is concerned. The original dragon has been dead for ages and the {{ wiki('Category:End', 'End' ) }} has been turned into {{ wiki('Ender_ender_2.0', 'an XP farm') }}. The lunchbox which will be part of your {{ wiki('Tour', 'server tour') }} has things like an Ender chest in it. We also have beacons pretty much everywhere. If you want to start from scratch, expect to be playing singleplayer style for a while.</li>
    <li>We think of a lot of stuff as public which you might expect to be treated differently. For example, the <code>!{{ wiki('Commands#Leak', 'Leak') }}</code> command allows people to publish parts of the chatlog to Twitter, and all sorts of in-game data like your inventory and statistics are publicly available through <a href="//api.{{g.host}}/v2/">our API</a>.</li>
    <li>We have a {{ wiki('Code_of_Conduct', 'code of conduct') }}.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now for the actual invitation process, read {{ wiki('Invitations', 'this wiki page') }}. See <a href="/">the main page</a> for ways to contact us.</p>
<h2 id="starter">Getting started</h2>
<p>If you're new and don't know where to go and what to do, chances are you didn't get a {{ wiki('Tour', 'server tour') }} by one of our more senior members. Sorry about that. The first thing you'll see is our {{ wiki('Category:Spawn', 'spawn area') }}, which is rather obviously still being built, like so many things on the server. “Beneath” the spawn area is our {{ wiki('Newther_Hub', 'Nether hub' ) }}, which serves as a central community trafficking area and connects various tunnels to other peoples's Nether portals. Both the Nether hub and spawn area are community oriented builds. All the supplies there are either donated or specifically collected for specific builds or purposes, so… well, the general rule is “Don't be a dick”. If something has a sign with “free to take” on it, you can probably take it. Taking <em>everything</em> is generally frowned upon for reasons of obviousness. Also, even if there are usually some community supplies floating around (like steak), please don't rely on them as your only means of, you know, not starving to death.</p>
<p>If you'd like to work on community builds like spawners, {{ wiki('Category:Farms', 'farms' ) }} or whatever, please try to ask around some of the other people who may or may not have already started preparations for such builds. It's not about <em>owning</em> a community project, it's just about coordination and not stepping on people's toes. However, experience shows that you probably won't be murdered in your sleep if you build at spawn without discussing every minor detail with everyone. Hanging around on {{ wiki('Slack', 'Slack') }} and/or checking out the <a href="https://twitter.com/wurstmineberg">Twitter account</a> and/or checking out the {{ wiki('/', 'wiki') }} should give a start as to what's currently going on. And sometimes it doesn't.</p>
<p>As I was saying, it's about community. As long as you're being reasonable and remember you're not alone on this server (both for your and everybody else's benefit), everything's fine.</p>

<p>To finance our server, we thought it'd be a nice idea to copy <a href="http://uberspace.de/">Uberspace's</a> model: You settle for the amount you want to contribute every month and send that to Jemus42, who rented and pays the server. The relevant reddit threads are <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/wurstmineberg/comments/1lykcp/geldgeldgeld/">here for the pledges, where people said what they'd be willing to contribute</a> and the older thread about <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/wurstmineberg/comments/1k5abo/psa_sollten_wir_ein_vserverupgrade_wollen_dies/">the general situation and what server we'd be getting</a>. There's also a private spreadsheet where <a href="/people/jemus42">Jemus42</a> collects data about what everyone has pledged to pay, what expenses we have and of course the actual transactions will be collected there as well. For obvious reasons, this isn't public.</p>
<p>To contribute, you'll need to talk to Jemus42. You can chat him up via Jabber at <a href="xmpp:jemus42@kuchen.io"><code>jemus42@kuchen.io</code></a>.</p>
