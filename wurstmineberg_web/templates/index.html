        <p class="lead">Wurstmineberg is a whitelisted vanilla <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a> server.</p>
        <p>The main world usually runs the latest stable version of Minecraft. We don't run any serverside mods due to the work that would require. But we do have some awesome selfmade tools that really replace lots of that functionality. Sometimes a member also runs a {{ wiki('Mod', 'modded world') }}.</p>
        <p>If you're interested in playing with us, we have some <a href="/about#joining">requirements</a>. In the meantime, you can check out the Twitter section below.</p>

        <p>We set up <a href="http://mapcrafter.org/">Mapcrafter</a> to generate a daily overview map of our main world. It runs a lot faster than <a href="//overviewer.org/">Minecraft Overviewer</a> (which we used before Mapcrafter), but it's still kind of experimental.</p>

        <p>We use <a href="https://discordapp.com/">Discord</a> for communication internally, since it has both text and voice chat. Because sometimes it's just nice to talk to people.</p>
        <p>If you're a server member or would like to be, you can ask the more active members for an invite link.</p> {#TODO display Discord username on profile, display Discord logo in people list #}

        <p>We integrated Twitter in our server/IRC bot and now we have <abbr title="It tends to get kinda spammy when new users arrive but you will get used to it">automated tweets</abbr>. Sometimes it's a death message, sometimes it's the server telling us that he's lonely, sometimes it's a list of currently online players, sometimes a snippet from IRC shenanigans. <abbr title="At least we tried!">It's emotional</abbr>.</p>
        <p>It's also the <abbr title="For certain values of easy, at least">easiest</abbr> way to get in touch with us.</p>

        <p>Since we're running on an actual server that requires actual monies to run, we decided to try a “Donate if you will, or don't but it would be pretty dandy if you would” model.</p>

        <p>We have a GitHub organization where we keep most of our stuff, like <a href="https://github.com/wurstmineberg/wurstminebot">the IRC bot</a>, <a href="https://github.com/wurstmineberg/systemd-minecraft">the systemd service file we use to manage our worlds</a>, and even <a href="https://github.com/wurstmineberg/wurstmineberg.de">this website</a>. We also have three single-serving sites for the current <a href="//time.{{g.host}}/">server time</a>, <a href="//isitraining.{{g.host}}/">weather conditions</a>, and <a href="//accidents.{{g.host}}/">time since the last death on the server</a> (<abbr title="Seriously. We need Javascript for nearly everything">Javascript required</abbr>). There's also the <a href="//api.{{g.host}}/">Wurstmineberg API</a>, which makes a lot of cool stuff possible, like our statistics page.</p>

        <p>We're still sort of setting everything up on our new server, so the new wiki isn't online yet.</p> {#TODO#}

        <p>We have <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/">MediaWiki</a> to harvest the glorious benefits of wiki-technology for our purposes.</p>
        <p>Besides meta stuff, we're also writing articles about {{ wiki('Category:Projects', 'projects') }} on the server itself. This might not seem like a big deal as of now, but things are slowly coming together, and eventually we'll have documented <em>all</em> the things.</p>
        <p>There are also articles about {{ wiki('Category:Fictional', 'fictional content') }}. Fun stuff.</p>
