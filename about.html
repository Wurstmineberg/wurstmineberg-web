            <h2 id="hosting">Hosting <small>Because Minecraft doesn't run on potatoes</small></h2>
            <p>Since our user expansion in September '13, we were capable to cough up the funds for a <em>real</em> server. We are now running on a dedicated server from <a href="http://www.nessus.at/">Nessus</a>, where other services known for their <a href="http://www.soup.io/">magnificient performance</a> have been hosted on before. Specifically, <a href="http://www.nessus.at/produkte/rootserver/l">this is our current server</a>. It seems to be able to handle our server with reasonable load while also generating our <a href="http://overview.wurstmineberg.de">map overview</a> once a day, so it's quite the step up from our previous vServer solution.</p>
            <p>For more details and a brief history of the server, read <a href="http://wiki.wurstmineberg.de/Hosting">the Hosting article on our wiki</a>.</p>
            <h2 id="joining">Joining <small>Want to play with us?</small></h2>
            <p>If you're thinking about joining the server or wondering how you can, read on. First, though, there are a few things we would like to let you know about what playing on the server is like.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We're a <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Version_history/Development_versions">snapshot</a> server, which means that we're helping Mojang improve their game. Expect weirdness and make yourself familiar with <a href="https://bugs.mojang.com/">the bug tracker</a>.</li>
                <li>We're pretty much end-game, as far as <a href="/stats#achievements">the achievement progress</a> is concerned. The dragon has been dead for ages and the <a href="http://wiki.wurstmineberg.de/Category:End">End</a> has been turned into <a href="http://wiki.wurstmineberg.de/Ender_ender_2.0">an XP farm</a>. The lunchbox which will be part of your <a href="http://wiki.wurstmineberg.de/Tour">server tour</a> has things like an Ender chest in it. We also have beacons pretty much everywhere. If you want to start from scratch, expect to be playing singleplayer style for a while.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Now for the actual invitation process, read <a href="http://wiki.wurstmineberg.de/Invitations">this wiki page</a>. See <a href="/">the main page</a> for ways to contact us.</p>
            <h2 id="starter">Getting started</h2>
            <p>If you're new and don't know where to go and what to do, chances are you didn't get a server tour by one of our more senior members. Sorry about that. The first thing you'll see is our spawn area, which is rather obviously still being built, like so many things on the server. "Beneath" the spawn area is our Nether Hub, which serves as a central community trafficing area and connects various tunnels to other peoples's nether portals. Both the nether hub and spawn area are community oriented builds. All the supplies there are either donated or specifically collected for specific builds or purposes, so … Well, the general rule is "Don't be a dick". If something has a sign with "free to take" on it, you can probably take it. Taking <em>everything</em> is generally frowned upon for reasons of obviousness. Also, even if there are usually some community supplies floating around (like steak), please don't rely on them as your only means of, you know, not starving to death.</p>
            <p> If you'd like to work on community builds like spawners, farms or whatever, please try to ask around some of the other people who may or may not have already started preparations for such builds. It's not about <em>owning</em> a community project, it's just about coordination and not stepping on people's toes. However, experience shows that you probably won't be murdered in your sleep if you build at spawn without discussing every minor detail with everyone. Hanging around on the <a href="irc://chat.freenode.net/#wurstmineberg">IRC channel</a> and/or checking out the <a href="http://twitter.com/wurstmineberg">Twitter account</a> and/or checking out the <a href="http://reddit.com/r/wurstmineberg">subreddit front page</a> should give a start as to what's currently going on. And sometimes it doesn't.</p>
            <p>As I was saying, it's about community. As long as you're being reasonable and remember you're not alone on this server (both for your and everybody elses' benefit), everything's fine.</p>
            <h2 id="finance">Financial stuff</h2>
            <div class="funding-progress-container-about">
                	<p class="funding-text-container">Funding<span class="funding-text"> <span class="funding-for">for </span><span class="funding-month">(loading)</span><span class="funding-month-small">(loading)</span></span>:</p>
                	<div class="funding-progressbar progress progress-striped active">
                    	<div class="progress-bar" style="width: 100%;">
                        <span class="sr-only">loading</span>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>To finance our server, we thought it'd be a nice idea to copy <a href="http://uberspace.de">Uberspace's</a> model: You settle for the amount you want to contribute every month and send that to Jemus42, who rented and pays the server. The relevant reddit threads are <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/wurstmineberg/comments/1lykcp/geldgeldgeld/">here for the pledges, where people said what they's be willing to contribute</a> and the older thread about <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/wurstmineberg/comments/1k5abo/psa_sollten_wir_ein_vserverupgrade_wollen_dies/">the general situation and what server we'd be getting</a>. There's also a private spreadsheet where Jemus42 collects data about what everyone has pledged to pay, what expenses we have and of course the actual transactions will be collected there as well. For obvious reasons, this isn't be public.</p>
            <p>To contribute, you'll need to talk to Jemus42. You can chat him up via Jabber at <a href="xmpp:jemus42@kuchen.io"><code>jemus42@kuchen.io</code></a>.</p>
