We call it USC and we already managed to play 4 matches, which is at least 3 more than we would have expected, given our talent for scheduling. There are many other things we'll probably try sooner or later, so watch out for stuff to happen!</p>

        <p>USC is short for <em>Ultra SoftCore</em>, and it's the name of our very own, slightly awkwardly named version of the UHC game style invented and popularized on the Mindcrack server. You can find more info on the game and an overview of past USCs on <a href="http://wiki.wurstmineberg.de/Ultra_Softcore">this wiki page</a>.</p>
