We call it USC and we already managed to play 3 matches, which is at least 2 more than we would have expected, given our talent for scheduling. There are many other things we'll probably try sooner or later, so watch out for stuff to happen!</p>

        <h1 class="page-header">USC <small>An overview of past USCs</small></h1>
        <p>USC is short for <em>Ultra SoftCore</em>, and it's the name of our very own, slightly awkwardly named version of the UHC game style invented and popularized on the Mindcrack server. The rules vary from match to match (like on Mindcrack UHC), but the primary difference is that we give players another chance when they die from environmental damage (hostile mobs, fall damage, fire/lava). We mainly do that because we're exceedingly happen to even manage to get 4 people scheduled for a match, and having that match end after 30 minutes because someone derped up would kind of defeat the point of having a fun game.</p>
        <h2>USC III <small>2013-10-05</small></h2>
        <p><strong>Participants:</strong> <em>Team Aqua</em>: Fenhl, Papierschiff, Jemus42, <em>Team Light Purple</em>: L3viathan, Naturalismus, Farthen</p>
        <p><strong>Rules:</strong> Since we managed to get a decent number of players this time (i.e. P &gt; 4) and even had an even number, we went for a team deathmatch, 3v3 last team standing. Besides that Fenhl and L3viathan built a little USC-box: A redstone contraption to automate team randomization and the death timeout. The timeout wen this way: A dead player respawned in a bed in a bedrock box, where he could either leave the game if he died a genuine PvP death, or step on a pressure plate which teleported him on top of enough cobwebs for a 10 minute fall. After that fall he would be randomly teleported on a spot on the map via the /scatter command, thus ensuring fun times in terms of finding back to one's team while trying not to die horribly. It went <em>okay</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>Winners:</strong> Team Light Purple (L3viathan, Naturalismus, Farthen)</p>

        <h2>USC II <small>2013-08-07</small></h2>
        <p><strong>Participants:</strong> <em>Team A:</em> L3viathan, Fenhl, <em>Team B:</em> BenemitC, Farthen<p>
        <p><strong>Rules:</strong> 2 vs 2 vs Ender Dragon. If you die through non-player, you respawn. This is the first time this rule appeared.</p>
        <p><strong>Notable Events:</strong> L3viathan had his bow streched for 10 minutes just so that farthen finds him and gets damaged immediately. This was extremely successful except for the fact that their team still died first. (But they did so in the End which made them actually <em>winning</em>. We revised that rule pretty quickly.) Also L3viathan and Fenhl had horses. Pretty fast ones even. Yay.</p>
        <p><strong>Winners:</strong> Team A (L3viathan, Fenhl)</p>

        <h2>USC I <small>$date</small></h2>
        <p><strong>Participants:</strong> <em>Team A:</em>Jemus42, Farthen, <em>Team B:</em> L3viathan, Fenhl<p>
        <p><strong>Rules:</strong> If you die you're dead. When the game is over collaborative everyone vs Ender dragon game.</p>
        <p><strong>Notable Events:</strong> In the everyone vs Enderdragon game, everyone died beforehand except Farthen who then died after spending 20 seconds in the End.</p>
        <p><strong>Winners:</strong> Team A (Jemus42, Farthen)</p>
